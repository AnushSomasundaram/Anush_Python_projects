#the logic operators in python are and ,or,not
#these operators are used with operands that have boolean values of true and false
#remember logic gates (or and and not gates)yeah its practically same thing except instead of drawing
#them were writing them in code
#the syntax for logic operators are -> value+operator+2nd value

a=True
b=False

print("And logic operator")
print("a and a =", a and a)
print("a and b", a and b)
print("b and b",b and b)

print("\nOr logic operator")
print("a or a =", a or a)
print("a or b", a or b)
print("b or b",b or b)

#while and and or take multiple values the not operator is a unary operator

print("a=",a,"not a=",not a)
print("b=",a,"not b=",not b)
